// Summary: Illustrating the behavior of default constructors and member functions 
//          in C++ structs. The program defines two structs, A and B, each with 
//          constructors and member functions. It then uses a lambda function to 
//          conditionally create objects of these structs and call their member functions.

#include <iostream>

// Definition of struct A
struct A {
    // Default constructor printing "a" upon construction
    A() { std::cout << "a"; }

    // Member function foo() printing "1"
    void foo() { std::cout << "1"; }
};

// Definition of struct B
struct B {
    // Default constructor printing "b" upon construction
    B() { std::cout << "b"; }

    // Constructor taking a const reference to A, printing "B" upon construction
    B(const A&) { std::cout << "B"; }

    // Member function foo() printing "2"
    void foo() { std::cout << "2"; }
};

int main() {
    // Lambda function L taking a flag parameter
    auto L = [](auto flag) -> auto {
        // Return an object of type A if flag is true, otherwise return an object of type B
        // Detailed explanation:
        // - The lambda uses the conditional operator (?:). If the second and third operands 
        //   (in this case, A{} and B{}) have different types and at least one is a class type, 
        //   the compiler tries to find an appropriate implicit conversion.
        // - The conversion is done via the constructor B(const A&). Since B has a constructor 
        //   taking a const reference to A, the compiler can implicitly convert a temporary A 
        //   object created by A{} into a B object. 
        // - The return type of L is always B due to the implicit conversion. In the case of true, 
        //   a temporary A object is constructed and then converted to B before being returned. 
        //   In the case of false, direct creation of a B object yields the same result.
        return flag ? A{} : B{};
    };

   // Call foo() member function on the object returned by L(true), printing "aB2"
// Explanation: When flag is true, the lambda function returns an object of type B.
// Since B has a constructor that can take a const reference to an A object,
// an A object is first constructed and then implicitly converted to a B object.
// The resulting B object is then used to call the foo() member function, printing "aB2".
L(true).foo();

// Call foo() member function on the object returned by L(false), printing "b2"
// Explanation: When flag is false, the lambda function directly returns an object of type B.
// This B object is then used to call the foo() member function, printing "b2".
L(false).foo();
}
